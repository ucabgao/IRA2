When you first log in, the games we have are games where you played with another user who previously registered.
We begin watching your games after the first login.
You're also added to a queue to get your full match history.
This can take a while depending on how long the queue is.

Note on full history: due to Valve API limitations, we can only get 500 games per hero per player.
If you really wanted, you could request the remaining matches manually by ID.
