This site is run as a side project of a couple of college students.
As such, we don't intend to make a profit from it.
We're also happy to share our knowledge with the community by completely open-sourcing the entire site and stack we run it on.

Development is done by volunteers contributing in their free time, so  we don't need to pay employees.
Donations from users pay for server bills.
