You should donate!  It will make us happy.

We do our best to minimize server costs through efficient algorithmic decisions.
However, the remaining costs continue to be subsidized out-of-pocket.  

With the new "Cheese" feature, contributors can earn some swag points for their profile and help out with hosting costs all at once!

Community contributions would be greatly appreciated!
