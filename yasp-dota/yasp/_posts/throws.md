Introducing advanced analysis of throws.

<!--more-->

With parsed data of all our users, we're able to analyze really what causes a throw.

After many sleepless nights, the dev team has figured out exactly that, and have developed a new metric: the 322 Level.

Named in honor of Solo and his next-level attempt at revolutionizing the monetization of the professional Dota 2 scene, this statistic
consists of many variables that only our parsed data can provide. Here are a few of the aggregations and analyses included:

* Number of couriers bought and fed
* Aegis denies
* Percentage of Divine Rapiers delivered to enemy base
* Were Techies picked?
* Aggregate number of legs on team
* Allusions to throwing in all chat
* Similarity level of all chat to Twitch chat
* Number of times "space created" was said
* Average blood sodium content per team

Now that you have this valuable data, you can be sure that losing was entirely not your fault.

We hope you all enjoy this new statistic.

Have a happy April 1st.
