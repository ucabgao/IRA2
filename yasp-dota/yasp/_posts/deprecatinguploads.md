With the upcoming release v1.5, we've made the decision to remove uploads.  There are several reasons for this.

<!--more-->

* Security.  While unlikely, it was possible for malicious users to manually edit .dem replay files and upload them, leading to incorrect data.
* Usage.  Only about 160 replays were ever uploaded, while there were far more requests by ID.  Uploads were not a very used feature.
* Scalability.  Uploaded replays would have to be stored in a network-accessible location to allow parsing on a distributed architecture.  We want to minimize costs.
* Maintainability.  It was hard to test this feature properly with a large variety of old replay files, so we couldn't be sure that it worked on legacy files.

On the other hand, we've worked to improve the match request by ID experience, including the use of sockets for live updates!
