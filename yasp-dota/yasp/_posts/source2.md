We're proud to now support Source 2 matches.

<!--more-->

Along with supporting the new match type, we're making two important changes:

* Removal of all ads - Thanks the generosity of our users, we're receiving enough money through cheese to support our costs. Removing ads will give users a better user experience!
* Untracking is now two weeks - Untracking has always confused users and hurt the user experience. Extending the untracking period will hopefully make it less of an issue.

Shout out and major thanks to [Martin Schrodt](https://github.com/spheenik) who finished Clarity's Source 2 support just in time. Without his work, YASP wouldn't be possible.

And as always, thanks to all our users!
