<p>No matter what source of suggestion you use, you can always cache responses so that the client won't need to reach the server in case user repeats the search.</p>

<p>In this demo, you will perceive a 1 sec. delay for first request. But if you repeat the same search, you will get immediate answer.</p>

<p>One need to provide <tt>cached</tt> flag and setup <tt>minLength</tt> which declares how long the user input needs to be to reach server.</p>

<p>It is also possible to pass custom caching provider using <tt>cacheImplemenation</tt> option. Default implementation is <tt>$.ui.autocomplete.objectCache</tt>.</p>
