Weathercheck Privacy Policy

tl;dr By using Weathercheck, you are broadcasting your physical location to the 
Internet. If you have a reason to keep your physical location secret or even obscure, 
don't use Weathercheck. (I don't need or want to know who is using my app, but I do
get a warm and fuzzy feeling knowing that someone is using an app that I created.)

Weathercheck protects your location data in transit by using SSL. Click the lock 
icon in your browser to verify the certificate.

<p>Weathercheck uses HTML5 geolocation[1], which may in turn uses your device's 
built in GPS as well as other sources such as cellular and WiFI networks to 
determine the location of your device-- and by association, your location. Your 
coordinates are used to display a map of your geographic area, the current weather 
conditions and forecast at your location, and active severe weather notices that 
apply to your location.</p>

(If Weathercheck is not able to determine your location using the information provided
by your device, your IP address may be used to try to match your general location.)

<p>Server logs are kept that record the coordinates that are returned as a result 
of geolocation, the time and date, your device's IP address, and information about 
the type of device you are using and the web browser you are using. An example of 
the information collected in the server access log appears below.

<pre> server IP - - [31/Oct/2013:20:52:50 -0700] "OPTIONS * HTTP/1.0" 200 136 "-" 
"apache" your device IP - - [31/Oct/2013:20:53:10 -0700] "GET 
/cgi-bin/hazardLinks.cgi?lat=43.00000&lon=-89.00000 HTTP/1.1" 200 715 "-"

Chromium/28.0.1500.71 Chrome/28.0.1500.71 Safari/537.36" </pre>

I do not collect, store (except as described above), use, sell, or share 
information about you or your device. I do not track or have access to who you 
are, the nature or direction of your travel, where you have been, or where you 
will be. I only know that a person with a device capable of being located has 
accessed my app from a particular latitude and longitude.  Your web browser will 
alert you to the use of geolocation each time you access Weathercheck, and if you 
do not authorize geolocation, Weathercheck does not know where you are.</p>

Weathercheck itself does not store or access cookies. APIs that Weathercheck uses 
do store cookies in your web browser. The companies that provide these APIs do 
collect information about you, and the privacy policies for those services are 
listed below. If you do not wish your location and device information to be 
available to any/all of these third parties, please do not use Weathercheck.
